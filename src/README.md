# Castor Labs

Castor Labs mission is to help PHP developers write maintainable, robust and efficient PHP applications.

We do this by actively:

1. Pushing for what we consider to be best practices in the PHP community
2. Proposing and implementing standards for the PHP community
3. Publishing packages with useful abstractions for PHP projects

We differ from the PHP FIG in one big crucial point: our goal is not interoperability, but rather, to make our
packages the de-facto building blocks in which you can build your PHP applications.

We are not a closed organization, and our libraries and standards are open for revision and contribution by anyone
in the PHP Open Source community.

Every package is independent and has their own maintainer(s). We don't have a coordinated release cycle like
Symfony or other vendors do. Instead, we rely on semantic versioning, and empowering maintainers to push the changes
they consider necessary to the packages they maintain.

Check out some of the packages we have, or you can also read some of our standards.
